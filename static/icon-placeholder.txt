# PWA Icon Placeholders

To complete PWA setup, add the following icon files:
- icon-192.png (192x192px)
- icon-512.png (512x512px)

You can create these using:
1. Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Image editors like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma
3. AI image generators

Recommended icon design:
- Music note or headphones symbol
- Gradient from #ec4899 (pink) to #fb7185 (light pink)
- White or light symbol on dark background
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes

For now, the app will work without icons, but they enhance the user experience.
